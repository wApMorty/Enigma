# Enigma
My work on a simplified Enigma machine

This Enigma machine runs the Interface / Rotor / Reflector model, without the plugboard at the end, and knowing the I/O of each part of the machine.

However this might seem really easy to do, that was a challenge a friend sent me, and it was done for the most part in a 4 hours straight rush.

As I'm still learning, feel free to commit any possible upgrade so I can learn and get better :)
